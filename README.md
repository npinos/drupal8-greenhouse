# drupal8-greenhouse
## Drupal 8 and Greenhouse API integration

This module includes an example of how to leverage the <a href="https://developers.greenhouse.io/job-board.html">Grenhouse job board API</a> to create local instances of job posts as Drupal nodes.

This is useful to fully customize your job board instead of using a greenhouse hosted solution.

### Also included
- Example of custom Drush command to run the Drupal-Greenhouse sync process
- Custom endpoint to fetch the job post count using drupal routing and controllers

This example uses the API defined here: https://github.com/minnur/GreenhouseJobBoardAPI
